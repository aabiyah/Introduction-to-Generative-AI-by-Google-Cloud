## Definitions
- **Generative AI**: Type of AI technology that produces content (text, imagery, audio, synthetic data).
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Discipline of computer science focused on creating intelligent agents that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Subfield of AI where models are trained to make predictions from data without explicit programming.

## Types of Machine Learning Models
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models to predict or classify future data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Uses unlabeled data to discover patterns or group data.

## Deep Learning
- **Deep Learning**: Subset of ML using artificial neural networks to process complex patterns. Inspired by the human brain with interconnected nodes (neurons).

## Generative vs. Discriminative Models
- **Discriminative Models**: Classify or predict labels based on data.
- **Generative Models**: Generate new data instances based on learned probability distributions.

## Generative AI
- **Generative AI**: Subset of deep learning that creates new content from learned data.
  - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Generate text based on training data.
  - **Generative Image Models**: Create images, videos, or text from input data.
  - **Generative Language Models**: Predict and generate text based on input.

## Model Types
- **Text-to-Text**: Translates or generates text from text input.
- **Text-to-Image**: Generates images from text descriptions.
- **Text-to-Video**: Creates videos from text input.
- **Text-to-3D**: Generates 3D objects from text descriptions.
- **Text-to-Task**: Performs actions based on text input.

## Generative AI Applications
- **Code Generation**: Converts code between formats or languages, generates documentation, etc.
- **Vertex AI Studio**: Tools for exploring, customizing, and deploying generative AI models.
- **Vertex AI**: No-code tools for building chatbots, search engines, etc.
- **PaLM API**: Access to Google's large language models and tools for model integration.

## Challenges
- **Hallucinations**: Nonsensical or incorrect outputs from models, caused by insufficient or noisy training data.

## Advanced Tools
- **Gemini**: Multimodal AI model that analyzes text, images, audio, and code.

## Conclusion
- Generative AI represents a significant advancement from traditional programming and neural networks, offering new capabilities in content creation and model deployment.
